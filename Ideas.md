In future to take this project forward, an idea is to store data of all possible outcomes and import the file, 
so as to not calculate all possible outcomes for every single step, 
thus, increasing speed of the calculations, moresoever when faced with the problem of calculating outcomes of large number of games, 
for example, in number of thousands, simply for sake of calculating probability data.

Another idea is to implement a game where the computer chooses either winning the game, losing the game as only possibilities, 
eliminating the tie games out of possible outcomes since they are boring.
